It is based on the idea that investors can maximize their expected return on investment by diversifying their portfolio across a range of assets. According to MPT, the expected return on a portfolio is determined by the combination of the individual returns of the assets within the portfolio and their corresponding risk levels. The risk of an asset is measured by its standard deviation, which is a measure of the amount of variation in the asset's return. MPT also introduces the concept of the efficient frontier, which is a curve that represents the portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk. Portfolios that lie on the efficient frontier are considered to be optimal, as they offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk. MPT has been influential in the field of finance and has been widely adopted by investors and financial managers. However, it has also been criticized for its assumptions about investor behavior and its reliance on historical data.\n","\n","**Assumptions**:\n","\n","- Investors are rational and aim to maximize their expected return.\n","- Investors are risk averse and seek to minimize their risk.\n","- Asset returns are approximately normally distributed$^*$ \n","\n","$^*$This is indeed not true. The real assumption is that the *utility* of the investor can be well approximated by a quadratic form, which allows to be described by a function of only the first and second moments of the return distribution. But saying that returns are normally distributed is easier.\n","\n","Under these assumptions, MPT introduces several key concepts and formulas to help investors create an optimal portfolio. We consider $N$ risky assets in which the investor might or not invest. The goal is then to obtain the proportion of the investor's money, or weight, $\\omega_i$, that he/she should invest in each asset $i$. Thus, a portfolio is defined by a unique set of weights $\\{\\omega\\}$, or in a more useful and precise way, by a vector $\\vec{\\omega}$ in which, as previously said, $\\omega_i$ indicates the proportion of the investor's wealth allocated in each asset $i$. Being this definition clear, let $\\vec{R}$ be the return matrix of the considered assets in which the element $r_{ij}$ is the return of asset $i$ at time $j$. Thus, the components of the mean return vector, $\\vec{\\mu}$, of the considered assets are defined as $\\mu_i=\\frac{1}{t}\\sum_{j=1}^tr_{ij}$. With this information, we define the following statistical measures over a given portfolio:\n","\n","<ins>**Expected Return**</ins>\n","\n","The expected return of a portfolio is calculated as the sum of the expected returns of each asset multiplied by their respective weights in the portfolio:\n","\n","$$ \\mu_p=E[R_p] = \\sum_{i=1}^N w_iE[R_i]=\\vec{\\omega}^T \\vec{\\mu} $$\n","\n","where:\n","\n","- $\\mu_P$ is the expected return of the portfolio\n","- $w_i$ is the weight of asset $i$ in the portfolio\n","- $E[R_i]$ is the expected return of asset $i$\n","- $N$ is the number of assets in the portfolio\n","\n","<ins>**Standard Deviation**</ins>\n","\n","The standard deviation of a portfolio is calculated as the square root of the sum of the covariance between each pair of assets multiplied by their respective weights:\n","\n","$$ \\sigma_P=\\sqrt{V[R_p]} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^N\\sum_{i=1, j=1}^N w_i\\,\\Sigma\\,w_j}=\\sqrt{\\vec{\\omega}^T\\,\\vec{\\Sigma}\\,\\vec{\\omega}}$$\n","\n","where:\n","\n","- $\\sigma_P$ is the standard deviation of the portfolio\n","- $w_i$ is the weight of asset $i$ in the portfolio\n","- $\\Sigma=Cov(R_i,R_j)$ is the covariance between assets $i$ and $j$\n","- $N$ is the number of assets in the portfolio\n","\n","<ins>**Standard Deviation**</ins>\n","\n","The standard deviation of a portfolio is the square root of the variance:\n","\n","$$ \\sigma_p = \\sqrt{\\sigma_P^2} $$\n","\n","where:\n","\n","- $\\sigma_p$ is the standard deviation of the portfolio\n","- $\\sigma_P^2$ is the variance of the portfolio\n","\n","<ins>**Sharpe Ratio**</ins>\n","\n","The Sharpe ratio is a measure of the risk-adjusted return of a portfolio.

Note that if $\\lambda=0$ (the investor is not risk-averse), the optimization problem reduces to maximizing the expected return regardless of the risk involved.
