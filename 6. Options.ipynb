right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset, such as a stock, at a specific price (**strike price**, $K$) on or before a specific date (**expiration date**, $T$). The seller, or option writer, is obligated to fulfill the terms of the contract if the buyer chooses to exercise their option. Options can be used for a variety of purposes, such as hedging risk or speculating on the price movement of an asset. There are two main types of options: **call** options, which give the buyer the right to buy the underlying asset, and **put** options, which give the buyer the right to sell the underlying asset.
