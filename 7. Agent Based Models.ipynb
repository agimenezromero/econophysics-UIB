Voter Model\n","\n","The voter model is a mathematical model used to describe the dynamics of opinions or preferences in a population. It is typically used to model the spread of opinions or behaviors in a social network.\n","\n","The model starts with a randomly assigned set of opinions or behaviors for each individual. At each time step, each individual independently adopts the opinion or behavior of one of its neighbors. The process continues until a consensus is reached, where all individuals in the population have the same opinion or behavior.\n","\n","In this way, the voter model is a simple representation of how individuals can be influenced by the opinions or behaviors of their peers, leading to the emergence of a consensus.\n","\n","Different types of networks can be considered for the underlying contact structure of the individuals, which controls who is the neighbor of who.\n","\n","## Complete graph (fully connected network)\n","\n","A complete graph, also known as a full graph or a universal graph, is a simple graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. The degree distribution, $P(k)$ of a complete graph with $N$ nodes is given by\n","\n","$$P(k)=\\delta(k-(N-1))$$\n","\n","this is, all nodes have degree $N-1$ since each node is connected to all others except themselves.\n","\n","## Barabasi-Albert\n","\n","The Barabasi-Albert (BA) model is a generative model for creating scale-free networks, which have a power-law degree distribution. The model begins with a small number of nodes, and at each time step, a new node is added to the network with a probability proportional to the degree (number of edges) of the existing nodes. The new node is then connected to $m$ existing nodes, where $m$ is a fixed parameter.\n","\n","The probability that a node with degree k is chosen to be connected to the new node is given by the following probability mass function:\n","\n","$$P_i = \\frac{k_i}{\\sum_{j=1}k_j}$$\n","\n","The degree distribution of a network generated by the BA model follows a power-law distribution:\n","\n","$$P(k) \\propto k^{-\\gamma}$$\n","\n","with $\\gamma > 0$.\n","\n","\n","## Watts-Strogatz\n","\n","The Watts-Strogatz (WS) model is a generative model for creating small-world networks, which have a high degree of clustering and a small average shortest path length. The model begins with a regular lattice, where each node is connected to its k nearest neighbors. Then, each edge is rewired with probability $p$, meaning that it is disconnected from its original endpoint and reconnected to a randomly chosen node. For small values of p, the WS model creates networks that are highly clustered and have long average shortest path length. As p increases, the clustering decreases, and the average shortest path length decreases.\n","\n","The degree distribution, $P(k)$ of a network generated by the WS model depends on the value of $p$, being a dirac Delta when $p=0$ and a Poisson distribution for $p=1$.\n","\n","\n","## Erdös–Rényi\n","\n","The Erdös–Rényi model, also known as the binomial graph model, is a random graph model used in network theory.

However, some individuals, referred to as contrarians, choose to deviate from the crowd and make decisions that are contrary to the majority.\n","\n","The model predicts that in the short-term, imitative behavior will dominate and drive prices away from their fundamental values, while contrarian behavior will eventually restore market efficiency and push prices back towards their fundamentals.\n","\n","In mathematical terms, let's consider a market with $N$ agents and a stock price $P$.

The model assumes that each agent $i$ is influenced by $m$ *other* agents and can either follow the majority decision of their neighbours of buying or selling the stock (imitation behavior), or take the opposite action (contrarian behavior).
