# Econophysics Hands-On Notebooks ‚Äî University of the Balearic Islands (UIB)

This repository contains a collection of **Jupyter notebooks** used in the hands-on practice sessions of the *Econophysics* elective course, part of the 4th-year curriculum in the B.Sc. in Physics at the **University of the Balearic Islands (UIB)**.

These interactive materials are designed to complement theoretical lectures, providing practical exposure to core methods and concepts in Econophysics.

## Contents

- üìì Jupyter notebooks used during practical sessions
- üß™ Simulations of stochastic processes and market models
- üìä Analysis of real or synthetic financial time series
- ‚öôÔ∏è Tools from statistical physics applied to economic systems

## Topics Covered

1. **Getting Started with Python and Financial Data**  
   Introduction to working with financial time series in Python using packages like `pandas`, `yfinance`, and `matplotlib`. Downloading, preprocessing, and visualizing stock price data.

2. **Modelling Price Dynamics**  
   Implementation and simulation of basic stochastic models for asset prices, including random walks and geometric Brownian motion. Comparison with empirical data.

3. **ARCH and GARCH Processes**  
   Modeling volatility clustering in financial returns using ARCH and GARCH models. Parameter estimation and forecasting.

4. **Correlations in Financial Data**  
   Construction and analysis of correlation and covariance matrices. Visualization with heatmaps. Exploration of systemic risk and asset interdependence.

5. **Portfolio Optimization**  
   Mean-variance optimization, efficient frontier, and risk-return trade-offs. Practical implementation of basic portfolio theory using real asset data.

6. **Options**  
   Introduction to options and their valuation. Simulation and pricing using the bionmial and Black-Scholes models.

## Requirements

These notebooks require a standard Python scientific stack (e.g. `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `yfinance`, `networkx`, etc.).
